##Publishing
As you edit the site, the public at large will not be able to see your changes until you publish the site.  
WordPress will also display a notification, reminding you that the site has changed and needs publishing:

When you want to publish the site, click on [Site Publisher](admin:admin.php?page=simply-static) in the left 
hand navigation.

On the Site Publisher page, simply click the very large blue **Publish** button.  This process should take 
no more than a minute or two and you do not need to stay on the page to wait for it to complete.

That's all you need to do to publish changes.  Always double check the live site after publishing to make
sure the site published correctly.
